QUESTION: What is Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC), and what are its capabilities?

ANSWER: Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) allows users to launch AWS resources within a virtually isolated network that they have defined, which is similar to a conventional network that could be found in a personal data center but offers the scalability of AWS's infrastructure. Users can specify an IP address range, create subnets, add gateways, associate security groups, and launch resources like Amazon EC2 instances. Additionally, VPCs can be connected to the internet, to other VPCs, corporate or home networks, and users can control the traffic routes with route tables. The global AWS private network facilitates low-latency and secure inter-region communication.

QUESTION: What are the differences between IPv4 and IPv6 addressing in Amazon EC2 and Amazon VPC?

ANSWER: IPv4 and IPv6 addresses have distinct differences when utilized within Amazon EC2 and Amazon VPC. IPv4 addresses are 32-bit numbers separated into four groups, allowing for a variety of IP addressing configurations with VPC sizes ranging from /16 to /28. They can be selected by users or allocated through Amazon VPC IP Address Manager, necessitating an internet gateway for online access and enabling the use of Elastic IP addresses for static public IP association. NAT gateways support IPv4 for internet and inter-VPC communications. In contrast, IPv6 addresses are 128-bit numbers separated into eight groups, offering VPC sizes from /44 to /60 in increments of /4, also configurable via Amazon VPC IP Address Manager. IPv6 requires an internet gateway as well but does not support Elastic IP addresses since they are static by default. IPv6 is compatible with NAT gateway and NAT64 for communication with IPv4 resources and has the added benefit of enabling instances to be assigned globally unique addresses that can be private or internet-accessible. Both addressing schemes offer DNS hostnames and network interfaces that receive Amazon-provided DNS names, but the IPv6 address persists through instance stops and starts, only being released upon instance termination.

Q&A:
QUESTION: What are the requirements and restrictions for associating IPv4 CIDR blocks with an Amazon VPC?

ANSWER: When creating or managing an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), you need to specify an IPv4 CIDR block, which must have an associated block size between a /16 netmask and a /28 netmask. Additionally, you can associate more IPv4 CIDR blocks and IPv6 blocks if needed. However, there are several restrictions to consider. For instance, the CIDR block must not overlap with any existing block associated with the VPC, it cannot expand beyond the limits of the existing CIDR block, and it must not conflict with certain reserved IP address ranges. Furthermore, there are specific quotas on the number of CIDR blocks you can associate, and the CIDR range cannot be the same or larger than any existing route destination in the VPC's route tables. There are also stipulations relating to VPC peering connections and AWS Direct Connect usage, as well as limitations when associating CIDR blocks from the same or differing RFC 1918 ranges. In the context of VPC peering, you cannot add CIDR blocks that overlap with a peer VPC, and when connected to multiple VPCs through AWS Direct Connect, you must ensure non-overlapping CIDR blocks among associated VPCs. Lastly, when adding or removing CIDR blocks, they go through various states such as associating, associated, disassociating, disassociated, failing, or failed, and only when in the 'associated' state are they ready for use.

Q&A:
QUESTION: What are the constraints and reserved IP addresses when sizing subnets for IPv4 and IPv6 in an Amazon VPC?

ANSWER: When sizing subnets within an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), there are specific constraints for both IPv4 and IPv6 CIDR blocks. IPv4 CIDR blocks can range between a /28 netmask and /16 netmask (with the smallest subnet supporting 16 IP addresses and the largest 65,536). However, the first four and last IP address in an IPv4 subnet are reserved and cannot be assigned to resources; they serve purposes such as network address and network broadcast address. Similarly, for IPv6, the allowed netmask lengths vary between /44 and /64 in increments of /4, with the same reservation rules applying to the first four and last IPv6 addresses in a subnet CIDR block. These addresses are reserved for network uses like the VPC router and AWS use. For instance, in an IPv4 subnet with a CIDR block of 10.0.0.0/24, the reserved addresses include 10.0.0.0 for the network itself, 10.0.0.1 for the VPC router, 10.0.0.2 for the DNS server, 10.0.0.3 for future AWS use, and 10.0.0.255 for network broadcast. In an IPv6 subnet with a CIDR block of 2001:db8:1234:1a00/64, reserved addresses include the base address 2001:db8:1234:1a00::, several subsequent addresses for the VPC router and AWS use, and the last address in the block for subnet broadcast. These reservations ensure network stability and the proper functioning of the virtual networking infrastructure within the AWS environment.

Q&A:
QUESTION: What are the benefits and rules of using customer-managed prefix lists in Amazon VPC?

ANSWER: A managed prefix list in Amazon VPC is a collection of CIDR blocks that simplifies the configuration and maintenance of security groups and route tables. Customers can create these lists from frequently used IP addresses and use them in security group rules and route tables as a set, rather than individually. This allows for easier updates and scalability because adding another CIDR block to the network requires only an update to the prefix list, not to each individual security group that references it. Customer-managed prefix lists have specific rules: they support a single type of IP addressing (IPv4 or IPv6), apply to the region where they were created, must have a specified maximum entry count, and impact the resource quota when referenced in a resource. Modified prefix lists create a new version, ensuring resources always use the most recent version, and these lists come with quotas and are available in all commercial AWS Regions. Additionally, IAM policies can be configured to control user permissions for managing these prefix lists.

Q&A:
QUESTION: How can AWS users manage customer-managed prefix lists in Amazon Virtual Private Cloud?

ANSWER: AWS users can manage customer-managed prefix lists in Amazon Virtual Private Cloud by creating, viewing, modifying, resizing, restoring, and deleting prefix lists. When creating a prefix list, users must specify the maximum number of entries it can support, and there are limitations when adding the prefix list to a security group rule. Users can view both their own prefix lists and those that are shared with them, as well as AWS-managed prefix lists. They can modify existing prefix lists, including changing the name and adding or removing entries; however, they cannot modify an AWS-managed prefix list. Resizing operations allow for changing the maximum number of entries up to 1000, while restoring allows users to revert to a previous version of a prefix list. Finally, users must remove all references to a prefix list before deleting it, and they cannot delete an AWS-managed prefix list. These tasks can be performed via the Amazon VPC console or by using specific AWS CLI commands provided for each action.

Q&A:
QUESTION: What are AWS-managed prefix lists and how are they used with AWS resources?

ANSWER: AWS-managed prefix lists are sets of IP address ranges associated with AWS services, maintained by AWS for use by AWS account holders. These prefix lists cannot be created, modified, shared, or deleted by users but can be employed within AWS resources like security groups and route tables. This utility helps define network access controls and routing policies by referencing AWS service endpoints without the need to manage the underlying IP addresses directly, facilitating a more efficient and secure AWS resource management.

Q&A:
QUESTION: How can AWS account owners share a prefix list using AWS Resource Access Manager (AWS RAM)?

ANSWER: With AWS Resource Access Manager (AWS RAM), the owner of a prefix list can share it with specific AWS accounts, organizational units, or an entire organization within AWS Organizations. Consumers of the shared prefix list can then view and reference it in their own AWS resources. To share, the owner must first create or add the prefix list to a resource share via the AWS RAM console or AWS CLI. If sharing within an organization is enabled, access is automatically granted; otherwise, an invitation is sent to potential consumers. Owners must have ownership of the prefix list, as shared or AWS-managed prefix lists cannot be shared. 

QUESTION: What happens when an AWS account owner unshares a prefix list, and how is it done?

ANSWER: When an owner unshares a prefix list, consumers lose the ability to view or reference the prefix list and its entries in their accounts. However, any existing references to the prefix list in consumers' resources remain functional, and if the prefix list is updated, these references will use the latest version. To unshare a prefix list, the owner must remove it from the resource share using AWS RAM through the AWS RAM console or by using the AWS CLI command 'disassociate-resource-share'.

QUESTION: What are the permissions associated with AWS account owners and consumers in relation to a shared prefix list?

ANSWER: Owners of shared prefix lists are responsible for managing the lists and have the ability to view the AWS resource IDs referencing them, but they cannot alter these references in consumer-owned resources nor delete a prefix list if it's in use by a consumer's resource. Consumers can view shared prefix list entries and reference them in their resources but are not permitted to modify, restore, or delete the shared prefix list. 

QUESTION: Are there any additional charges for sharing prefix lists in AWS?

ANSWER: No, AWS does not charge additional fees for sharing prefix lists.

Q&A:
QUESTION: What is an Amazon VPC and how does it function within the AWS infrastructure?

ANSWER: An Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) allows customers to launch AWS resources in a virtual network that they have authority to define. This virtual network resembles a traditional network that would exist in a data center but benefits from the scalable infrastructure offered by AWS. Within a VPC, customers can define their own IP address range, create subnets, and configure gateways and route tables to direct traffic. Resources such as Amazon EC2 instances can be launched into these subnets. The network can be accessed through a variety of ways, including internet gateways for internet access, VPC peering connections for private routing between VPCs, and connections to corporate or home networks through a Site-to-Site VPN. The system can handle both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and provides options to connect with the internet, whether directly or through a NAT device. AWS also maintains a private global network to ensure high-performance and low-latency connectivity across their infrastructure.

Q&A:
QUESTION: What are the steps to get started with Amazon VPC as outlined by the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud user guide?

ANSWER: The steps to get started with Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) include signing up for an AWS account, verifying permissions, determining your IP address ranges, selecting your Availability Zones, planning your internet connectivity, creating your VPC, and deploying your application. The process begins with creating an AWS account and verifying that you have the necessary permissions to use Amazon VPC. Next, you need to determine the IP address ranges your resources will use to communicate within your VPC and with the internet, ensuring they do not overlap with other networks. Availability Zones must be selected with consideration for fault tolerance, and internet connectivity planned out by creating subnets based on traffic requirements. After these preparations, you can create your VPC with the necessary configuration for internet access and subnets. Finally, you can deploy your application, taking into account whether it's for production or development purposes, with options for scaling, load balancing, and using services like Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling or Amazon ECS.

Q&A:
QUESTION: What are the main features and differences between IPv4 and IPv6 addresses in Amazon VPC?

ANSWER: IPv4 and IPv6 addresses facilitate communication within Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and with the internet. An IPv4 address is 32 bits long, represented in decimal, and an IPv6 address is 128 bits, represented in hexadecimal. VPCs can be sized up to 5 CIDRs with adjustable quotas, though IPv4 CIDR blocks can range from /16 to /28, while IPv6 CIDR blocks are fixed at /56. Subnets in IPv4 can also range from /16 to /28, but IPv6 subnets are fixed at /64. IPv4 allows users to choose or allocate a CIDR block using Amazon VPC IP Address Manager (IPAM), while for IPv6, users can bring their own CIDR block or choose one provided by Amazon, or allocate using IPAM. Both require an internet gateway for internet access, but only IPv4 supports Elastic IP addresses for static public IP assignment. NAT gateways are supported in both address types, which help instances in private subnets connect to the internet or other VPCs. Instances receive Amazon-provided DNS names, which resolve to corresponding IP addresses. Notably, IPv4 addresses can be private and only enable internal communication unless public IPs are used, and IPv6 addresses can be globally unique and Internet-reachable, but can also be configured to remain private. IPv6 addresses assigned to an instance or network interface are static and persist through stops and starts but are released upon instance termination. Moreover, users have the option of bringing their own publicly routable IP addresses which AWS will advertise on the internet, and managing these addresses through Amazon VPC IP Address Manager (IPAM).

Q&A:
QUESTION: What are the size limitations and recommendations when creating an IPv4 CIDR block for an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)?

ANSWER: When creating an IPv4 CIDR block for an Amazon VPC, the block size needs to be between a /16 netmask (65,536 IP addresses) and a /28 netmask (16 IP addresses). It is recommended that the CIDR block come from the private IPv4 address ranges as specified in RFC 1918. Specifically, AWS advises against using the 172.17.0.0/16 CIDR range to avoid conflicts with certain AWS services like AWS Cloud9 or Amazon SageMaker that could experience IP address conflicts. If you choose to create a publicly routable IPv4 CIDR block that is outside the RFC 1918 private range, it's important to consider the AWS services' requirements and verify any specific configuration needs in the service documentation. Additionally, when using command line tools or the Amazon EC2 API to create a VPC, the specified CIDR block is automatically modified to its canonical form.

Q&A:
QUESTION: How does AWS recommend using CIDR blocks for creating subnets within a VPC, and what are some reserved IP address considerations?

ANSWER: When creating subnets within an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), AWS recommends using Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks. A subnet's CIDR block can match the VPC's to create a single subnet, or be a subset to create multiple subnets, with block sizes allowed between a /28 and /16 netmask. It's important to ensure that the subnets’ CIDR blocks do not overlap if more than one subnet is created. In a subnet, certain IP addresses are reserved and cannot be assigned to resources; for instance, if a subnet has a CIDR block of 10.0.0.0/24, AWS reserves the first four IP addresses for specific uses such as the network address, VPC router, and DNS server, as well as the last IP address, which is the network broadcast address. Similarly, for IPv6 subnets with a fixed prefix length of /64, the first four and the last IPv6 addresses in each subnet CIDR block are reserved and cannot be assigned to an EC2 instance. Additional IPv6 addresses are also reserved for the default VPC router, including a link-local IPv6 address. Tools and network engineering groups can assist in calculating and creating the appropriate IPv4 and IPv6 CIDR blocks for subnets.

Q&A:
QUESTION: What are managed prefix lists in Amazon VPC and how can they be utilized?

ANSWER: Managed prefix lists in Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) are sets of CIDR blocks that users can create to simplify the configuration and maintenance of security groups and route tables. By grouping IP addresses regularly used into a prefix list, users can reference this set as a whole in security group rules and routes, instead of individually. This makes it easier to manage network configurations, especially when scaling the network, as updating the referenced prefix list will automatically apply the changes across all security groups that use it. Additionally, prefix lists help consolidate security group rules that share the same port and protocol for different CIDR blocks into a single rule. There are two types of prefix lists: customer-managed prefix lists, which are user-defined and can be shared with other AWS accounts; and AWS-managed prefix lists, which are predefined by AWS for use with AWS services and cannot be edited or shared by users.

URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/working-with-managed-prefix-lists.html
Q&A:
QUESTION: What are the main tasks that can be performed with customer-managed prefix lists in Amazon VPC?
ANSWER: In Amazon VPC, users can perform several tasks with customer-managed prefix lists, including creating, viewing, and modifying them. Creating a prefix list involves specifying the maximum number of entries it can support. Viewing prefix lists allows users to see their own prefix lists, those shared with them, and AWS-managed prefix lists. Modifying a prefix list enables changes to its name and the addition or removal of entries, although this cannot be done with AWS-managed prefix lists. Users can also resize a prefix list, restoring a previous version, or delete a prefix list. However, deleting requires the removal of any references to the prefix list in user resources first, and AWS-managed prefix lists cannot be deleted. These tasks are integral to managing how network traffic is routed and controlled in AWS environments.

Q&A:
QUESTION: What is the process and prerequisites for sharing a prefix list with other AWS accounts or organizations using AWS Resource Access Manager (AWS RAM)?

ANSWER: To share a prefix list with specific AWS accounts, organizational units, or an entire organization within AWS Organizations, you must first own the prefix list and it must not be one that was shared with you or an AWS-managed prefix list. If sharing with your organization or an organizational unit in AWS Organizations, you need to enable sharing with AWS Organizations. You then add your prefix list to a resource share through the AWS RAM console or by using AWS CLI commands, such as create-resource-share, associate-resource-share, and update-resource-share. When part of an organization, consumers in your organization automatically get access if sharing is enabled; otherwise, they receive an invitation and must accept it to access the shared prefix list.
