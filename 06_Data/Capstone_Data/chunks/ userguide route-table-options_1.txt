You can make a subnet a public subnet by adding a route in your subnet route table to an internet gateway. To do this, create and attach an internet gateway to your VPC, and then add a route with a destination of 0.0.0.0/0 for IPv4 traffic or ::/0 for IPv6 traffic, and a target of the internet gateway ID (igw-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx).0.0.0.0/0 igw-id ::/0 igw-idFor more information, see Connect to the internet using an internet gateway.Routing to a NAT deviceTo enable instances in a private subnet to connect to the internet, you can create a NAT gateway or launch a NAT instance in a public subnet. Then add a route for the private subnet's route table that routes IPv4 internet traffic (0.0.0.0/0) to the NAT device.
