Outbound rules use the destination IP address for evaluation.Inbound rules use the source IP address for evaluation.NACL rules are applied as follows for traffic from the transit gateway to the instances:Outbound rules are not evaluated.Inbound rules are not evaluated.Different subnets for EC2 instances and transit gateway associationConsider a configuration where you have EC2 instances in one subnet and a transit gateway association in a different subnet, and each subnet is associated with a different network ACL.Network ACL rules are applied as follows for the EC2 instance subnet:Outbound rules use the destination IP address to evaluate traffic from the instances to the transit gateway.Inbound rules use the source IP address to evaluate traffic from the transit gateway to the instances.NACL rules are applied as follows for the transit gateway subnet:
